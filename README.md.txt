	For my final project I plan to design a game in which 
a car on the bottom of the screen will “drive” through obstacles 
that move down the screen from top to bottom. In terms of input 
I plan to have two buttons that will control the cars movement 
left or right. My plan for building the game begins by first 
implementing the basic functionality. For this section I will 
need to write code that allows the user to press either button 
to start the game and then play the game by driving the car through 
the obstacles. Once the players dies the game will stop and restart 
upon pressing another button. Assuming that I can accomplish this 
functionality efficiently, I would also like to implement power ups 
into the game. If the player manages to drive through a powerup the 
game will perhaps boost the player by speeding up the loop or give 
the player invincibility against obstacles. On top of these functionalities 
I would also like to implement a splash screen with the name of the game 
and some cool art.
